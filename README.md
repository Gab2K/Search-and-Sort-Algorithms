# Search-and-Sort-Algorithms

This is a console Search and Sort application. The program contains 4 sorting algorithms:  insertion sort, quick sort, heap sort and bubble sort; and 2 searching algorithms: linear search and binary search.

To demonstrate the algorithms there are 6 files to choose from. The 256 and 2048 numbers correspond to the number of data points stored in the files. The user can sort any of the files with their choice of sorting algorithm and then search for a number within that file. For a file with 256 numbers, every 10th value will be displayed, and for a file with 2048 numbers every 50th value will be displayed. 

To launch run SearchSort.sln in Visual Studio.
